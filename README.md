## üì∏ Basic Screenshot Tool in Python (CMD Version)

If you're just starting, the simplest way to **take a screenshot in Python** is by using the `pyautogui` library.

### Step 1: Install pyautogui
Open your terminal and install the library:

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

### Step 2: Write the Script
Here's the minimal Python script to capture the entire screen:

```python
import pyautogui

screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
screenshot.save("screenshot.png")
```

‚úÖ That's it! Run this script, and it will automatically capture your current screen and save it as `screenshot.png` in your working directory.

## üìÇ How to Add an App Icon
To make the window even more polished, you can add a custom `icon.ico`:

- Download free icons from [IconArchive](https://iconarchive.com/) or [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).
